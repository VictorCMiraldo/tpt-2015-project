Prelude
=======

Repo to keep track of my TPT-2015 project, at Utrecht University.

Task
====

The project consists of an exploration of different separation semantics
in Agda.

Typechecking
============

In order to typecheck the modules, please copy the file `Repo/Prelude.agda.bckp` to `Repo/Prelude.agda` and make sure you have the current directory in the 
search path. This is named with a `bckp` because I already have my prelude
in my standard library, so Agda does not complain about clashing modules.
